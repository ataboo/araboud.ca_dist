&lt;p>I usually use Trello for tracking tasks in home projects, but have been interested in logging time. This was a good excuse to try out a proper React app with Golang back-end. I have found Gin very handy and I think it will be my server of choice for Go moving forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ataboo/go-natm.git">project on github&lt;/a> but be warned that it is very much a work in progress.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
