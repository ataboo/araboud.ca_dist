The eventual plan is for it to be an aerial imaging platform that doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a runway for launch and retrieval. For now, just getting it to hover stably has been quite the challenge.
Configuration Initially I had planned on this being a tri-copter with even distribution and forward sweeping wings on conversion, but this had a lot of un-needed complexity and the cost of the rear engine would be high.</description></item><item><title>Not Another Task Manager (GoNATM)</title><link>https://araboud.ca/projects/gonatm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2020 19:30:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://araboud.ca/projects/gonatm/</guid><description>I usually use Trello for tracking tasks in home projects, but have been interested in logging time. This was a good excuse to try out a proper React app with Golang back-end. I have found Gin very handy and I think it will be my server of choice for Go moving forward.
Feel free to check out the project on github but be warned that it is very much a work in progress.</description></item></channel></rss>
