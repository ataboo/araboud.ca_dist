The eventual plan is for it to be an aerial imaging platform that doesn&rsquo;t need a runway for launch and retrieval. For now, just getting it to hover stably has been quite the challenge.</p><h2 id=configuration>Configuration</h2><p>Initially I had planned on this being a tri-copter with even distribution and forward sweeping wings on conversion, but this had a lot of un-needed complexity and the cost of the rear engine would be high.</p><p><img src=/imgs/pandion/tricopter_concept.png alt="Tri-copter Whiteboard Concept"></p><p>The main concern was to put the C of G in the right positionon during forward flight and being able to balance while hovering. I&rsquo;ve been getting more comfortable with Fusion 360 and it is an amazing tool to work with. I took the time to add the approximate weight of materials and the balance and weight was quite close in the finished product.</p><p>The latest configuration is pretty close to a V-22 Osprey so the genus Pandion seemed like an appropriate name. The ducted fan in the rear is purely for pitch control so I would consider it a bi-copter.</p><p><img src=/imgs/pandion/render_profile.png alt="Latest rendering of Pandion VTOL"></p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen other bi-copters that will balance 2 axes, but it has been nice to have one control motion per axis with the ducted fan handling pitch. Initially, I used small geared motors with encoders, but I had difficulty getting them to run consistently.</p><p><img src=/imgs/pandion/early_rotary_encoder.png alt="Early wing design using geared motors"></p><p>9g servos in the nacelles provide yaw control when hovering and role control in forward flight.</p><h2 id=materials>Materials</h2><p>You&rsquo;ll notice I originally used a carbon fibre main-spar and the axle for the nacelle. The extruded tube I used originally tended to crack and I had much better results with a proper weaved fibre tube later on. In early versions, I also used aluminum tig wire in combination as stringers in the wing. Later designs used aluminum c-channel for the main spar and a wooden rear spar which provide plenty of support.</p><p><img src=/imgs/pandion/channel_wing.png alt="Channel wing construction"></p><p>9g servos controlled the nacelle pitch and fine engine pitch control. While testing, I stripped a few nylon gear servos since the nacelles are quite front heavy. After replacing them with metal-gear servos, there hasn&rsquo;t been any problems. PLA has worked well for the wing ribs and various pieces. At some point, I may try out foam filament.</p><h2 id=electronics>Electronics</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve used an MPU-6050 gyro, a FlySky receiver, 3 small ESCs, 3 buck-converters, and an ESP-32 to control everything. A flight controller would have made things easier, but part of the challenge was writing the software from scratch. Also there is not a lot of control software that will change between configurations at run-time.</p><p><img src=/imgs/pandion/control_board.png alt="Control Board"></p><p>I then mounted the control board to the wing on a pivoting test stand to help develop the control software.</p><p><img src=/imgs/pandion/test_stand.gif alt="GIF of wing on test stand"></p><h2 id=software>Software</h2><p>The <a href=github.com/ataboo/pandion>Pandion VTOL</a> repo has all the software for the project. Early on, I used some arduino sketches, but I&rsquo;ve found ESP-IDF is easier to develop for a project like this.</p><p>The gyro is read over I<sup>2</sup>C so this was fairly easy to implement. I ended up polling periodically, but I may look into using interrupts at some point.</p><p>I managed to reverse engineer the FlySky receiver with the help of a logic analyzer. Currently I&rsquo;m providing the battery voltage as a sensor with a simple voltage divider, but the ground-work is there in-case I need more. The channel values are read on another pin digitally.</p><p><img src=/imgs/pandion/ibus_sensor_still.png alt="I-Bus sensor output on receiver"></p><p>Getting d-shot to work for the ESCs was a little tricky, but the logic analyzer and the output from a flight controller helped me tune the timing. I flashed the rear ESC with BL Heli to make it reversable.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve implemented a PID controller with a positive and neutral stability mode. I then wrote a tcp server so the ESP-32 acts as a WiFi hot-spot, for updating values remotely. I then created a <a href=https://github.com/ataboo/pandion-tcp-client>client in fyne</a> to send commands and this has made tuning the PID values much easier.</p><h2 id=will-it-fly>Will it Fly?</h2><p><img src=/imgs/pandion/pandion_flight_min.gif alt="Basement flight test"></p><p>The stability needs some work, but the power to weight to weight is plenty.</p><p><img src=/imgs/pandion/garage_test.png alt="Garage Test"></p><p>I will keep tuning the controls until I feel confident in its ability to hold station. Once that is done, I should be able to tune for forward flight with the safety net of hovering.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black-70 bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://araboud.ca/>&copy; araboud.ca 2020</a><div></div></div></footer><script src=/dist/js/app.3fc0f988d21662902933.js></script></body></html>
